The gramplet works on the person and the relations view.
The data for the gramplet comes from a CSV file, which can be edited with a normal editor.

The Format is:

`from;to;event;link to event`

example:

1789;1797;George Washington;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George\_Washington

The file name is `<locale>_data.txt `e.g. `da_DK_data.txt` for Denmark
Currently only two files are provided, `da_DK_data.txt` and `en_US_data.txt` which simply is a list of American presidents.

I have added all the danish census'es to the Danish data file. To avoid looking at this you can go into the settings for the person list, and make a filter. If you check the "use filter" checkbox, the historical list will not display the events starting with the text you have added. In my case the text is "Folket√¶lling"
